            comment: 'Fiore Dei Liberi’s term for a position with the blade held over or on the right shoulder.  In one version it is held horizontal almost resting on the shoulder. In another it is held at a 45-degree angle as if in a shoulder-level “high” guard, but with the opposite shoulder turned more forward. While he only depicts a right-side version, Fiore does list both a left & right Woman’s guard (Posta Dominarum dextra and sinixtra). The Women’s guard seems related to horizontal cut, as the posture can be assumed both preliminary to such a blow and as a result of such a blow.  Yet it is more likely this guard is actually a shoulder-level Vom Dach (high guard).'
